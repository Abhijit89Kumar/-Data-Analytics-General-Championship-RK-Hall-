# Data Analytics General Championship - RK Hall

This repository showcases cutting-edge data analysis and machine learning techniques through a collection of Jupyter notebooks and resources. Explore clustering algorithms, fine-tune language models, and interact with a web application demo.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Clustering Algorithms:** Uncover hidden patterns in your data using K-Means, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), DBSCAN, and HDBSCAN.
- **Model Fine-Tuning:** Elevate model performance by fine-tuning Mistral 7B, Gemma 2B, and BERT on specific tasks.
- **Web Application Demo:** Experience the power of these models firsthand through an interactive web app.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- **Notebook 1:**
    - **Clustering Algorithms:** Dive into various clustering techniques for in-depth data analysis (requires `Final_hopefully.csv` and `Unclustered_Demographic.csv`).
    - **Required Files:** Essential data and the `imputing_fxn.ipynb` notebook for preprocessing.
    - **For164 Zips-20240315T132840Z-001:** Additional data resources.
- **Notebook 2:**
    - **Fine-Tuning:** Enhance model performance on specific tasks using `LLm_on_10k_train.csv` and `filtered_health_data.csv`.
    - **Required Files:** Access the datasets needed for fine-tuning.
- **Web-app Screenshots:** Visualize the web app experience through screenshots.
- **Demo:** A video walkthrough of the web application.
- **Output:** Explore sample input-output pairs from the model in a CSV file.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Hugging Face:** Get a read access token from your Hugging Face settings and store it as `HF_READ_TOKEN` in your environment.
2. **Model Weights:** Download the fine-tuned models:
    - `model_llama2` (7B llama2 chathf)
    - `model_gemma` (2B gemma instruct)
    - `model_mistral` (7B mistral instruct)
3. **Data:** Ensure all required CSV files are in the correct directories as specified in the notebooks.

## üõ†Ô∏è System Requirements

- **Recommended:** GPU with at least 50GB VRAM for smooth performance.
- **Alternative:** If GPU VRAM is limited, load models onto CPU (slower processing).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** This repository is designed for experienced users familiar with data analytics, machine learning, and model fine-tuning.
